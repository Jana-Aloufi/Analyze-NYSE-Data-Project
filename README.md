# Analyze-NYSE-Data-Project
In Business Analytics Nanodegree Program I made Analyze NYSE Data Project.  Inside this project, I conducted my own data analysis and created a presentation file to shared my findings. I also created an Excel workbook that contained my calculations of the summary statistics, dashboard, and forecast scenarios for NYSE Data provided by the Udacity course.
